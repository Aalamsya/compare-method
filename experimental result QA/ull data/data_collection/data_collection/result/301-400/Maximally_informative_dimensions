√What is motivated by the fact that natural stimuli are typically confined by their statistics ? 	definiton
×Why stimulus-response functions may be either linear or nonlinear ? 	reason
√What are typically given as the probability of a neuron generating an action potential ? 	manner
√What is the goal of maximally informative dimensions ? 	definiton
×Why maximally informative dimensions does not make any assumptions about the Gaussianity of the stimulus set ? 	reason
√How the technique is more robust than other dimensionality reduction techniques ? 	manner
