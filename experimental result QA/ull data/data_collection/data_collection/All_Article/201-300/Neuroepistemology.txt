Neuroepistemology is an empirical approach to epistemology—the study of knowledge in a general, philosophical sense—which is informed by modern neuroscience, especially the study of the structure and operation of the brain involving neural networks and neuronal epistemology.[1] Philosopher Patricia Churchland has written about the topic and, in her book Brain-Wise, characterised the problem as "how meat knows".[2] Georg Northoff, in his Philosophy of the Brain, wrote that it "focuses on direct linkage between the brain on one hand and epistemic abilities and inabilities on the other."[3] 

Menachem Mazabow wrote that it "is necessary... to state the set of assumptions that are seen as fundamental to any neuro-epistemological inquiry."[4] 

Brown has noted the "tacit bias" in any observation, which is rooted in "assumptions on the nature of mind" that shape the research,[5] and for Hanlan and Brown, theory does not arise from data alone.[6] Crick has stated that it is impossible to pursue a difficult programme of research in neuroscience without some preconceived ideas, seen as inevitable by Churchland.[7][8] Stein, Brailowsky and Will have opined that such preconceptions about the central nervous system have tended to hamper research in certain areas.[9]
