The Copenhagen Institute for Futures Studies (Instituttet for Fremtidsforskning) is Denmark's and one of Scandinavia's largest Futures Studies think tanks. It was founded in 1970 by Professor Thorkil Kristensen, former OECD Secretary-General, Danish Minister of Finance and member of the Club of Rome. It is a non-profit think tank and its mission was from the outset to help Danish organizations (public and private) understand and plan for the trends that are shaping their long-term future. Today it is an international think tank.[1]

The Institute's research covers a wide variety of topics from identification and statistically based analysis of global trends to subjective and emotional responses to the future. The work of the Institute is interdisciplinary, and its staff covers a number of academic disciplines and professional backgrounds, including economics, political science, ethnography, psychology, engineering, public relations and sociology.[2]

The Institute's products include seminars, analyses, reports, newsletters, books, and the magazine Scenario.[3] Some of the Institute's books include:

    Creative Man: The Future Consumer, Employee, and Citizen. Copenhagen, Denmark: Copenhagen Institute for Futures Studies. 2004.
    Jensen, Rolf (1999). The Dream Society: How the Coming Shift from Information to Imagination will Transform your Business. New York: McGraw Hill.

The Institute is the Danish Partner of the EUROCONSTRUCT network, which provides analysis and forecasts of construction in 19 Western and Central Eastern European countries.

The work at the Institute rests on the assumptions outlined by military strategist Herman Kahn in his book: The Year 2000: A Framework for Speculation on the Next Thirty-three Years, and later adapted for strategic business planning by Pierre Wack from Royal Dutch Shell.
