DragonLord Enterprises, Inc. is an American corporation that develops games, mobile apps, and 3D simulations. Under the name Sequoia Consulting, it also specializes in robotics, machine learning, and applied artificial intelligence. DragonLord created the first adventure game running on a cell phone in the world. 
DragonLord created the first adventure game for cell phones in the world, Cavern Crawl, in 2001. DragonLord was the first developer in America to create games for cell phones, and one of the first in the world, after Nokia's Snake. DragonLord's Cavern Crawl and Mystic I Ching were factory-built into the firmware of such cell phones as the Kyocera Model 2235 handset, distributed by Verizon; the S14 Opal, distributed by Cricket and MetroPCS; and the 2255 and 2325, distributed by Sprint PCS in America and Virgin Mobile in the UK. The games were noted for providing animation and game play that were ahead of their time.

DragonLord also made multiple versions of Tetris, that were built into the factory firmware of various Kyocera handsets through at least 2004.
DragonLord's Sequoia Consulting created the software for a humanoid robot for NASA JPL in 2006. The robot was one of the first humanoid robots to integrate speech recognition of commands and speech generation of responses. It used a real-time expert system shell to plan and sequence actions. It used primitive model-based stereo vision to locate and track objects in its environment. It was able to turn, walk over to a spar, squat down, bend over, and pick the spar up, using an arm with no wrist joints.

DragonLord is featured in the book The Fat Man on Game Audio.
