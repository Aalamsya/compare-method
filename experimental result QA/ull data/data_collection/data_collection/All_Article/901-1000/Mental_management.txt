Mental Management explores, describes and studies the mental processes in their diversity. This psychology of cognitive consciousness was elaborated by Antoine de la Garanderie from the analysis of mental habits of numerous subjects.

The Mental Management theory was elaborated from numerous pedagogical dialogues since the 1970s.

It is linked to several previous theories, including the works on introspection by Jean Martin Charcot, Alfred Binet, Maine de Biran, the German school of WÃ¼rzburg and Albert Burloud, who was Antoine de la Garanderie's professor.

The fundamental concepts of Mental Management are evocation and mental project.

Although it doesn't have a phenomenological goal, Mental Management is based on several concepts of characterization of evocation :

the nature (or language) of the evocation : visual, auditive, verbal, etc.
the parameters used : concrete (P1), codes (P2), logical links (P3) or new links (P4)
the coding : first or third person
the place of meaning : spatial

and also to have a clear Mind for working and to strengthen working methods for the social problems at work.
