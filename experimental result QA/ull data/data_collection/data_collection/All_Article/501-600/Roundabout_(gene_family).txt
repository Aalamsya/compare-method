The Roundabout (Robo) family of proteins are single-pass transmembrane receptors that are highly conserved across many branches of the animal kingdom, from C. elegans to humans.[1] They were first discovered in Drosophila, through a mutant screen for genes involved in axon guidance. The Drosophila roundabout mutant was named after its phenotype, which resembled the circular traffic junctions (see roundabout).[2] The Robo receptors are most well known for their role in the development of the nervous system, where they have been shown to respond to secreted Slit ligands.[2][3][4] One well-studied example is the requirement for Slit-Robo signaling in regulation of axonal midline crossing. Slit-Robo signaling is also critical for many neurodevelopmental processes including formation of the olfactory tract, the optic nerve, and motor axon fasciculation.[5][6] In addition, Slit-Robo signaling contributes to cell migration and the development of other tissues such as the lung, kidney, liver, muscle and breast.[7][8] Mutations in Robo genes have been linked to multiple neurodevelopmental disorders in humans.
A large-scale screen of the Drosophila genome for mutants that exhibited axon guidance defects led to the discovery of the roundabout (robo) mutation.[9] In robo mutants, axons were observed to inappropriately cross and recross the midline. It was subsequently found that the secreted protein Slit was the ligand for the Roundabout receptor.[10] Vertebrate Slit proteins were identified shortly after, and were shown to bind both vertebrate and Drosophila Robo receptors and to mediate axonal repulsion of spinal cord explants.[4] It was several more years before a functional analysis of the vertebrate Slit and Robo mutants was performed; this analysis demonstrated that Slit-Robo signaling regulates commissural axon guidance in vertebrates as well.[11] While the vertebrate receptors Robo1 and Robo2 signal repulsion in response to Slit to prevent inappropriate midline crossing, a novel function for Robo3/Rig1 was discovered; unlike the other Robo receptors, it is required to promote midline crossing.
Phylogenetic analysis reveals that all Robo receptors have evolved from a common ancestral protein, with many subsequent diversification events occurring independently in different lineages.[1] The Robo gene was initially identified in Drosophila and has since been cloned in various species including mice and humans.[13] Drosophila have three Robo receptors: Robo1, Robo2, and Robo3.[14][15] In vertebrates, four Robo receptors have been identified: Robo1, Robo2, Robo3/Rig-1, and Robo4/Magic Roundabout.
In humans, Robo1 and Robo2 are located on chromosome 3p12.3, while Robo3 and Robo4 are found on chromosome 11p24.2. In mice, the corresponding Robo genes 1 and 2 are found on chromosome 16 and Robo genes 3 and 4 are located on chromosome 9.
In vertebrates, Robo1 undergoes complex alternative splicing, generating several isoforms including DUTT1, a variant that has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene.[17] Vertebrate Robo3/Rig1 is also alternatively spliced; its two splice products are expressed at different times during commisural axon guidance, and have opposing activities.
In humans, Robo1 is expressed generally throughout the central nervous system.[17] Robo2 is enriched in most regions of the adult and fetal brain, as well as in the adult ovary. Intermediate expression of Robo2 is seen in the fetal liver and adult lung, kidney, spleen, testes, and spinal cord.[19] Robo3/Rig1 is found in the hindbrain and spinal cord.[20] Robo4 is expressed in the heart, liver, lungs, kidney, muscle, small intestine, endothelial cells, and largely in the placenta.
Each member of the Robo family has a similar structure, consisting of five immunoglobulin-like domains, three fibronectin type III (FN3) repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with up to four conserved motifs (CC0-3). In all identified Robo receptors except for vertebrate Robo4, the Ig1 and Ig2 domains have been evolutionarily conserved and are crucial for binding to Slit ligands. Robo4 is unusual as it only contains two Ig and FN3 domains. However, recent research proposes that the vertebrate Slit2 protein can in fact bind to Robo4.
