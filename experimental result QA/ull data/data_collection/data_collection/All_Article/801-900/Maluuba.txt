Maluuba is a Canadian technology company conducting research in artificial intelligence and language understanding. Founded in 2011, the company was acquired by Microsoft in 2017.[6]

In late March 2016, the company demonstrated a machine reading system capable of answering arbitrary questions about J.K Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.[7] Maluuba's natural language understanding technology is used by several consumer electronic brands for over 50 million devices.
Maluuba was founded by two undergraduate students from the University of Waterloo, Sam Pasupalak and Kaheer Suleman.[9] Their initial proof of concept was a program that allowed users to search for flights using their voice.

In February 2012, the company secured $2 million in seed funding from Samsung Ventures.[10]

Since 2013, Maluuba has partnered with several companies in the smart phone, smart TV, automotive and IoT space.[11]

In August 2015 Maluuba secured a $9 million of Series A investment from Nautilus Ventures and Emerllion Capital.[12][8] Then in December 2015, Maluuba opened an R&D lab in Montreal, Quebec.[13][14]

By 2016 the company employed more than fifty people, and had published fifteen peer-reviewed research papers focused on language understanding.[15]

On January 13, 2017, Maluuba announced they had been acquired by Microsoft for $140M.[16] In July 2017, according to the reports, Maluuba closed its Kitchener-Waterloo office and moved employees to its Montreal office.
Maluuba's research centre opened in Montreal, Quebec in December 2015.[13] The lab is advised by Yoshua Bengio (University of Montreal) and Richard Sutton (University of Alberta). The lab has published fifteen peer-reviewed papers discussing some of its recent research.[18] The lab also partners with the University of Montreal MILA lab and McGill University.[19]

In late 2016 the company released two natural language datasets: NewsQA, focused on comprehension and Frames, focused on Dialogue.[20][21]

Maluuba has achieved 80% accuracy on the machine reading benchmark MCTest, outperforming other word-matching approaches by 8%, and surpassed the previous benchmark set for deep learning techniques, the DSTC2, by 3%, bringing it to 83%.
In June 2016, the company demonstrated a program called EpiReader which outperformed Facebook and Google in machine comprehension tests. Several research teams were able to match Maluuba's results since the paper was released.[23] EpiReader made use of two large datasets, the CNN/Daily Mail dataset released by Google DeepMind, comprising over 300,000 news articles; and the Children's Book Test, posted by Facebook Research, made up of 98 children’s books open sourced under Project Gutenberg.
The company has published research findings into dialogue systems which comprises natural language understanding, state tracking, and natural language generation.[26] Maluuba published a research paper on policy manager (decision maker) where the system is rewarded for a correct decision.[27] In 2016, Maluuba also freely released the Frames dataset, which is a large human-generated corpus of conversations.
The company conducts research into reinforcement learning in which intelligent agents are motivated to take actions within a set environment in order to maximize a reward.[30] The research team has also published several papers on scalability.
In June 2017, the Maluuba team was the first to beat the game Ms. Pac-Man for the Atari 2600 system.
