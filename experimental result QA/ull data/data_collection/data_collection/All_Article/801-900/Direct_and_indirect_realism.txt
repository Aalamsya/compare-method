The question of direct or naïve realism, as opposed to indirect or representational realism, arises in the philosophy of perception and of mind out of the debate over the nature of conscious experience;[1][2] the epistemological question of whether the world we see around us is the real world itself or merely an internal perceptual copy of that world generated by neural processes in our brain. Naïve realism is known as direct realism when developed to counter indirect or representative realism, also known as epistemological dualism,[3] the philosophical position that our conscious experience is not of the real world itself but of an internal representation, a miniature virtual-reality replica of the world.

Indirect realism is broadly equivalent to the accepted view of perception in natural science that states that we do not and cannot perceive the external world as it really is but know only our ideas and interpretations of the way the world is.[4] Representationalism is one of the key assumptions of cognitivism in psychology. The representational realist would deny that "first-hand knowledge" is a coherent concept, since knowledge is always via some means. Our ideas of the world are interpretations of sensory input derived from an external world that is real (unlike the standpoint of idealism, which holds that only ideas are real, but mind-independent things are not).

The main alternative to representationalism is anti-representationalism, the view according to which perception is not a process of constructing internal representations.
Aristotle was the first to provide a description of direct realism. In On the Soul he describes how a see-er is informed of the object itself by way of the hylomorphic form carried over the intervening material continuum with which the eye is impressed.[5]

In medieval philosophy, direct realism was defended by Thomas Aquinas.[5]

Indirect realism was popular with several early modern philosophers, including René Descartes,[6] John Locke,[6] G. W. Leibniz,[7] George Berkeley,[8] and David Hume.
Thomas Reid, a notable member of the Scottish common sense realism was proponent of direct realism.[10] Direct realist views have been attributed to Baruch Spinoza.[11] Immanuel Kant's empirical realism has also been interpreted as a form of direct realism.[12]

Late modern philosophers, J. G. Fichte and G. W. F. Hegel followed Kant in adopting empirical realism.[13][14] Gottlob Frege (in his paper "Über Sinn und Bedeutung") also subscribed to indirect realism.[15]

In contemporary philosophy, indirect realism has been defended by Edmund Husserl[16] and Bertrand Russell[8] Direct realism has been defended by Hilary Putnam,[17] John McDowell,[18][19] Galen Strawson,[20] and John R. Searle.[21]

However, epistemological dualism has come under sustained attack by other contemporary philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein (the private language argument) and Wilfrid Sellars in his seminal essay "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind". Indirect realism is argued to be problematical because of Ryle's regress and the homunculus argument. However, recently reliance on the private language argument and the Homunculus Objection has itself come under attack. It can be argued that those who argue for "inner presence", to use Antti Revonsuo's term,[22] are not proposing a private "referent", with the application of language to it being "private" and thus unshareable, but a private use of public language. There is no doubt that each of us has a private understanding of public language, a notion that has been experimentally supported;[23] George Steiner refers to our personal use of language as an "idiolect", one particular to ourselves in its detail.[24] The question has to be put how a collective use of language can go on when, not only do we have differing understandings of the words we use, but our sensory registrations differ.
