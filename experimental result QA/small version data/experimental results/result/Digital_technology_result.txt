No.5---> 0.0    15
Modern transistorized integrated circuit logic gates have MTBFs greater than 82 billion hours -LRB- 8.2 Â· 1010 hours -RRB- , and need them because they have so many logic gates .  

¡Ì5.Who introduced a version of the 16-row truth table ?

No.2---> 1.0    6
The most widely used simplification is a minimization algorithm like the Espresso heuristic logic minimizer within a CAD system , although historically , binary decision diagrams , an automated Quineâ€“McCluskey algorithm , truth tables , Karnaugh maps , and Boolean algebra have been used . 
No.3---> 2.0    0
The binary number system was refined by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz -LRB- published in 1705 -RRB- and he also established that by using the binary system , the principles of arithmetic and logic could be combined .
