The genetic code stored in DNA is `` interpreted '' by gene expression , and the properties of the expression give rise to the organism 's phenotype . 
No.4---> 1.0    10
Genomic DNA consists of two antiparallel and reverse complementary strands , each having 5 ' and 3 ' ends . 
No.5---> 1.0    11

¡Á4.How many types of RNA polymerases transcription is performed by in eukaryotes ? 
No.1---> 0.0    7
The genetic code stored in DNA is `` interpreted '' by gene expression , and the properties of the expression give rise to the organism 's phenotype . 
No.2---> 0.0    8
Such phenotypes are often expressed by the synthesis of proteins that control the organism 's shape , or that act as enzymes catalysing specific metabolic pathways characterising the organism .

Genomic DNA consists of two antiparallel and reverse complementary strands , each having 5 ' and 3 ' ends . 
No.4---> 0.0    13
-LRB- Perhaps surprisingly , the `` coding strand '' is not physically involved in the coding process because it is the `` template strand '' that is read during transcription . -RRB- 
No.5---> 0.0    22
Pol II includes a C-terminal domain -LRB- CTD -RRB- that is rich in serine residues . 

¡Á5.Why splicing extends the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression ? 
No.1---> 0.0    8
Such phenotypes are often expressed by the synthesis of proteins that control the organism 's shape , or that act as enzymes catalysing specific metabolic pathways characterising the organism . 
No.2---> 0.0    11
Genomic DNA consists of two antiparallel and reverse complementary strands , each having 5 ' and 3 ' ends . 
No.3---> 0.0    13
-LRB- Perhaps surprisingly , the `` coding strand '' is not physically involved in the coding process because it is the `` template strand '' that is read during transcription . -RRB- 
No.4---> 0.0    15
This RNA is complementary to the template 3 ' â† 5 ' DNA strand , which is itself complementary to the coding 5 ' â† 3 ' DNA strand . 
No.5---> 0.0    16
Therefore , the resulting 5 ' â† 3 ' RNA strand is identical to the coding DNA strand with the exception that thymines -LRB- T -RRB- are replaced with uracils -LRB- U -RRB- in the RNA . 

¡Á6.How many parts does every mRNA consists of ? 
No.1---> 0.0    0
Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product . 
No.2---> 0.0    1
