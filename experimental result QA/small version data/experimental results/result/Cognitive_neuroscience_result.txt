No.1---> 0.0	10
The damages in lesioned brains provide a comparable basis with regards to healthy and fully functioning brains . 
No.2---> 0.0	12
With the damage , we can compare how the healthy neural circuits are functioning , and possibly draw conclusions about the basis of the affected cognitive processes . 
No.3---> 0.0	32
This theory gained significant public attention , leading to the publication of phrenology journals and the creation of phrenometers , which measured the bumps on a human subject 's head . 
No.4---> 0.0	42
He discovered that removing the cerebellum in rabbits and pigeons affected their sense of muscular coordination , and that all cognitive functions were disrupted in pigeons when the cerebral hemispheres were removed . 
No.5---> 0.0	43
From this he concluded that the cerebral cortex , cerebellum , and brainstem functioned together as a whole .

These exist in the primary visual cortex and respond differentially to differently oriented presentations of light . 
No.2---> 3.5    75
Occasionally cognitive neuroscientists utilize other brain imaging methods such as PET and SPECT . 
No.3---> 3.8    19
The aggregate field view , meaning that all areas of the brain participated in all behavior , was also rejected as a result of brain mapping , which began with Hitzig and Fritschâ€™s experiments and eventually developed through methods such as positron emission tomography -LRB- PET -RRB- and functional magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- fMRI -RRB- . 
No.4---> 4.0    15
There were several stages in these disciplines that changed the way researchers approached their investigations and that led to the field becoming fully established 
No.5---> 4.0    63
On September 11 , 1956 , a large-scale meeting of cognitivists took place at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . 

¡Ì6.Who declared that the brain was the source of mental activity ? 
No.1---> 0.0	2
It has been suggested that the first person to believe otherwise was the Roman physician Galen in the second century AD , who declared that the brain was the source of mental activity , although this has also been accredited to Alcmaeon . 
No.2---> 0.0	5
In the early 19th century , Franz Joseph Gall and J. G. Spurzheim believed that the human brain was localized into approximately 35 different sections . 
No.3---> 0.0	7
Jackson studied patients with brain damage , particularly those with epilepsy . 
No.4---> 0.0	9
Jackson proposed that specific functions were localized to specific areas of the brain , which was critical to future understanding of the brain lobes . 
No.5---> 0.0	11
Perhaps the first serious attempts to localize mental functions to specific locations in the brain was by Broca and Wernicke .
