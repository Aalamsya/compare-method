¡Á1.What is a data structure in computer science ? 
No.1---> 1.667  2
Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications , and some are highly specialized to specific tasks . 
No.2---> 1.667  4
Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services . 
No.3---> 1.667  5
Usually , efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms . 
No.4---> 1.667  9
Thus , the array and record data structures are based on computing the addresses of data items with arithmetic operations ; while the linked data structures are based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself . 
No.5---> 1.667  14
Most assembly languages and some low-level languages , such as BCPL -LRB- Basic Combined Programming Language -RRB- , lack built-in support for data structures .

¡Á2.What do relational databases commonly use for data retrieval ?

¡Ì3.What does compiler implementations usually use to look up identifiers ? 
No.1---> 1.5    3
For example , relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval , -LSB- 3 -RSB- while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers . 
No.2---> 3.0    2
Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications , and some are highly specialized to specific tasks . 
No.3---> 3.0    4
Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services . 
No.4---> 3.0    5
Usually , efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms . 
No.5---> 3.0    7
Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory .
