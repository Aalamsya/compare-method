No.1---> 3.0    0
In Europe genetic modification is synonymous with genetic engineering while within the United States of America it can also refer to conventional breeding methods . 
No.2---> 3.0    2
In 1987 , the ice-minus strain of P. syringae became the first genetically modified organism -LRB- GMO -RRB- to be released into the environment when a strawberry field and a potato field in California were sprayed with it . 
No.3---> 3.0    8
`` Governing GMOs in the USA : science , law and public health '' . 
No.4---> 3.5    1
In 1983 , a biotech company , Advanced Genetic Sciences -LRB- AGS -RRB- applied for U.S. government authorization to perform field tests with the ice-minus strain of P. syringae to protect crops from frost , but environmental groups and protestors delayed the field tests for four years with legal challenges . 
No.5---> 4.0    7
GMOs also are involved in controversies over GM food with respect to whether food produced from GM crops is safe , whether it should be labeled , and whether GM crops are needed to address the world 's food needs . 

¡Ì5.Who was the term ` genetic engineering ' first coined by ? 
No.1---> 0.0    0
In 1976 Genentech , the first genetic engineering company , was founded by Herbert Boyer and Robert Swanson and a year later the company produced a human protein -LRB- somatostatin -RRB- in E.coli . 
No.2---> 2.0    4
Gene therapy is the genetic engineering of humans , generally by replacing defective genes with effective ones . 
No.3---> 3.0    1
In 1980 , the U.S. Supreme Court in the Diamond v. Chakrabarty case ruled that genetically altered life could be patented . 
No.4---> 3.0    6
Gene flow into related non-transgenic crops , off target effects on beneficial organisms and the impact on biodiversity are important environmental issues . 
No.5---> 4.0    2
In 1987 , the ice-minus strain of P. syringae became the first genetically modified organism -LRB- GMO -RRB- to be released into the environment when a strawberry field and a potato field in California were sprayed with it .

¡Ì6.What is another transformation method for plant and animal cells ? 
No.1---> 0.0    36
DNA is generally inserted into animal cells using microinjection , where it can be injected through the cell 's nuclear envelope directly into the nucleus or through the use of viral vectors . 
No.2---> 0.0    41
Another transformation method for plant and animal cells is electroporation .
