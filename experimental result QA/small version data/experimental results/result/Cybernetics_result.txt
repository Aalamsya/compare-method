   These shifts in thinking involve , among others , -LRB- a -RRB- a change from emphasis on the system being steered to    the system doing the steering , and the factor which guides the steering decisions ; and -LRB- b -RRB- new emphasis on    communication between several systems which are trying to steer each other '' .
