No.1---> 0.0    24
-LSB- 5 -RSB- The theoretical basis of closed loop automation is control theory . 
No.2---> 2.0    8
As the general theory of feedback systems , control theory is useful wherever feedback occurs . 
No.3---> 2.0    10
Control theory is a theory that deals with influencing the behavior of dynamical systems . 
No.4---> 2.0    12
Control systems may be thought of as having four functions : measure , compare , compute and correct . 
No.5---> 2.4    7
Although a major application of control theory is in control systems engineering , which deals with the design of process control systems for industry , other applications range far beyond this . 

¡Ì2.Which monitors the output and compares it with the reference ? 
No.1---> 0.0    2
To do this a controller is designed , which monitors the output and compares it with the reference . 
No.2---> 0.0    13
These four functions are completed by five elements : detector , transducer , transmitter , controller and final control element . 
No.3---> 0.0    14
The measuring function is completed by the detector , transducer and transmitter . 
No.4---> 0.0    15
In practical applications these three elements are typically contained in one unit .

A standard example of a measuring unit is a resistance thermometer . 

¡Á3.How many types of control loops are there ? 
No.1---> 0.0    0
Control theory is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and mathematics that deals with the behavior of dynamical systems with inputs , and how their behavior is modified by feedback . 
No.2---> 0.0    1
The usual objective of control theory is to control a system , often called the plant , so its output follows a desired control signal , called the reference , which may be a fixed or changing value . 
No.3---> 0.0    2
To do this a controller is designed , which monitors the output and compares it with the reference . 
No.4---> 0.0    3
The difference between actual and desired output , called the error signal , is applied as feedback to the input of the system , to bring the actual output closer to the reference . 
No.5---> 0.0    4
Some topics studied in control theory are stability -LRB- whether the output will converge to the reference value or oscillate about it -RRB- , controllability and observability .
