Hilbert and Lopez identify the exponential pace of technological change -LRB- a kind of Moore 's law -RRB- : machines ' application-specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months between 1986 and 2007 ; the per capita capacity of the world 's general-purpose computers doubled every 18 months during the same two decades ; the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months ; the world 's storage capacity per capita required roughly 40 months to double -LRB- every 3 years -RRB- ; and per capita broadcast information has doubled every 12.3 years . 
No.4---> 3.5    1
Humans have been storing , retrieving , manipulating , and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC , but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review ; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that `` the new technology does not yet have a single established name .

Most digital data today is still stored magnetically on hard disks , or optically on media such as CD-ROMs . 
No.4---> 3.5    21
As of 2007 almost 94 % of the data stored worldwide was held digitally : 52 % on hard disks , 28 % on optical devices and 11 % on digital magnetic tape . 
No.5---> 3.5    22
It has been estimated that the worldwide capacity to store information on electronic devices grew from less than 3 exabytes in 1986 to 295 exabytes in 2007 , doubling roughly every 3 years .
