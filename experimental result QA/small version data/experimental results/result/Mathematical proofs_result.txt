The philosophy of mathematics is concerned with the role of language and logic in proofs , and mathematics as a language . 
No.4---> 2.0    4
Proofs employ logic but usually include some amount of natural language which usually admits some ambiguity . 
No.5---> 2.0    6
Purely formal proofs , written in symbolic language instead of natural language , are considered in proof theory .

¡Á3.When did Islamic mathematics's further advances took place? 
No.1---> 4.5    1
The distinction between formal and informal proofs has led to much examination of current and historical mathematical practice , quasi-empiricism in mathematics , and so-called folk mathematics -LRB- in both senses of that term -RRB- . 
No.2---> 6.0    0
In the argument , other previously established statements , such as theorems , can be used .

No.3---> 2.5    8
The philosophy of mathematics is concerned with the role of language and logic in proofs , and mathematics as a language . 
No.4---> 3.0    1
In the argument , other previously established statements , such as theorems , can be used . 
No.5---> 3.0    3
Proofs are examples of deductive reasoning and are distinguished from inductive or empirical arguments ; a proof must demonstrate that a statement is always true -LRB- occasionally by listing all possible cases and showing that it holds in each -RRB- , rather than enumerate many confirmatory cases .
