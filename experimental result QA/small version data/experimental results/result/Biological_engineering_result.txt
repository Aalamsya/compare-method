No.1---> 1.0    4
In the non-medical aspects of bio-engineering , it is closely related to biotechnology , nanotechnology and 3D printing . 
No.2---> 1.333  8
The differentiation between biological engineering and biomedical engineering can be unclear , as many universities loosely use the terms `` bioengineering '' and `` biomedical engineering '' interchangeably . 
No.3---> 1.333  12
Biological engineering can be differentiated from its roots of pure biology or other engineering fields . 
No.4---> 1.333  15
Biological engineering uses both approaches in concert , relying on reductionist approaches to identify , understand , and organize the fundamental units , which are then integrated to generate something new . 
No.5---> 1.333  22

¡Ì2.Who theorized about the idea of a medical use for these biological machines ? 
No.1---> 0.0    0
Physicist Richard Feynman theorized about the idea of a medical use for these biological machines , introduced into the body , to repair or detect damages and infections . 
No.2---> 3.364  1
According to Professor Doug Lauffenburger of MIT , biological engineering -LRB- like biotechnology -RRB- has a broader base which applies engineering principles to an enormous range of size and complexities of systems ranging from the molecular level - molecular biology , biochemistry , microbiology , pharmacology , protein chemistry , cytology , immunology , neurobiology and neuroscience -LRB- often but not always using biological substances -RRB- - to cellular and tissue-based methods -LRB- including devices and sensors -RRB- , whole macroscopic organisms -LRB- plants , animals -RRB- , and up increasing length scales to whole ecosystems .
