¡Á1.What is welfare economics a branch of ? 
No.1---> 0.5    2
Such functions typically include measures of economic efficiency and equity , though more recent attempts to quantify social welfare have included a broader range of measures including economic freedom -LRB- as in the capability approach -RRB- . 
No.2---> 0.5    3
The field of welfare economics is associated with two fundamental theorems . 
No.3---> 0.5    6
Because of welfare economics ' close ties to social choice theory , Arrow 's impossibility theorem is sometimes listed as a third fundamental theorem . 
No.4---> 0.5    9
It assumes the following : With these assumptions , it is possible to construct a social welfare function simply by summing all the individual utility functions . 
No.5---> 0.5    15
According to this measure of social welfare , a situation is optimal only if no individuals can be made better off without making someone else worse off . 

¡Á2.How many fundamental theorems is the field of welfare economics associated with ? 
No.1---> 0.0    5
The second states that given further restrictions , any Pareto efficient outcome can be supported as a competitive market equilibrium . 
No.2---> 0.0    10
The early Neoclassical approach was developed by Edgeworth , Sidgwick , Marshall , and Pigou . 
No.3---> 0.0    15
It explicitly recognizes the differences between the efficiency aspect of the discipline and the distribution aspect and treats them differently . 
No.4---> 0.0    17
Further , efficiency dispenses with cardinal measures of utility , replacing it with ordinal utility , which merely ranks commodity bundles -LRB- with an indifference-curve map , for example -RRB- . 
No.5---> 0.0    19
Many economists use Pareto efficiency as their efficiency goal . 

¡Ì3.Why could a social planner use a social welfare function to pick the most equitable efficient outcome ? 
No.1---> 0.0    2
Such functions typically include measures of economic efficiency and equity , though more recent attempts to quantify social welfare have included a broader range of measures including economic freedom -LRB- as in the capability approach -RRB- . 
No.2---> 0.0    5
The second states that given further restrictions , any Pareto efficient outcome can be supported as a competitive market equilibrium . 
No.3---> 0.0    10
The early Neoclassical approach was developed by Edgeworth , Sidgwick , Marshall , and Pigou . 
No.4---> 0.0    11
It assumes the following : With these assumptions , it is possible to construct a social welfare function simply by summing all the individual utility functions . 
No.5---> 0.0    15
It explicitly recognizes the differences between the efficiency aspect of the discipline and the distribution aspect and treats them differently . 

¡Á4.Whose work is the New Welfare Economics approach based of ? 
No.1---> 0.0    5
The second states that given further restrictions , any Pareto efficient outcome can be supported as a competitive market equilibrium . 
No.2---> 0.0    10

Many economists use Pareto efficiency as their efficiency goal . 

¡Ì5.What will many economists use as their efficiency goal ? 
No.1---> 3.0    12
Many economists use Pareto efficiency as their efficiency goal . 
No.2---> 3.0    13
This ideal state of affairs can only come about if four criteria are met : There are a number of conditions that , most economists agree , may lead to inefficiency . 
No.3---> 3.0    24
Most economists specify social welfare functions that are intermediate between these two extremes . 
No.4---> 3.0    35
Also , the economists of the Austrian School question the relevance of pareto optimal allocation considering situations where the framework of means and ends is not perfectly known , since neoclassical theory always assumes that the ends-means framework is perfectly defined . 
No.5---> 3.5    0
Welfare economics is a branch of economics that uses microeconomic techniques to evaluate well-being -LRB- welfare -RRB- at the aggregate -LRB- economy-wide -RRB- level .
